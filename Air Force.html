        <h1>Indian Air Force</h1>
        <p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its complement of personnel and
            aircraft assets ranks as the third most powerful air force in the world.[11] Its primary mission is to
            secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflicts. It was officially established
            on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honoured India's aviation service
            during World War II with the prefix Royal.[12] After India gained independence from United Kingdom in 1947,
            the name Royal Indian Air Force was kept and served in the name of Dominion of India. With the government's
            transition to a Republic in 1950, the prefix Royal was removed.

            Since 1950, the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan. Other major operations
            undertaken by the IAF include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation Cactus and Operation Poomalai.
            The IAF's mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the IAF participating in United
            Nations peacekeeping missions.

            The President of India holds the rank of Supreme Commander of the IAF.[13] As of 1 July 2017, 170,576
            personnel are in service with the Indian Air Force.[14][15] The Chief of the Air Staff, an air chief
            marshal, is a four-star officer and is responsible for the bulk of operational command of the Air Force.
            There is never more than one serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. The rank of Marshal of the Air Force
            has been conferred by the President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26 January 2002,
            Singh became the first and so far, only five-star rank officer of the IAF.[</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Missions</h1>
        <p>
            The IAF's mission is defined by the Armed Forces Act of 1947, the Constitution of India, and the Air Force
            Act of 1950.[18] It decrees that in the aerial battlespace:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Defence of India and every part there of including preparation for defence and all such acts as may be
            conducive in times of war to its prosecution and after its termination to effective demobilisation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style: none; font-size: 20px;">
            <li>The Primary objective of IAF is to defend the nation and its airspace against Air threats in
                coordination with Army and Navy.</li>
            <li>The secondary purpose is to assist civil power during natural calamities and internal disturbances.</li>
            <li>The IAF provides close air support to the Indian Army troops in the battlefield and also provides
                strategic and tactical airlift capabilities.</li>
            <li>The IAF provides close air support to the Indian Army troops in the battlefield and also provides
                strategic and tactical airlift capabilities.</li>
            <li> The IAF also operates the Integrated Space Cell together with the other two branches of the Indian
                Armed Forces, the Department of Space and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).</li>
            <li>Rescue of civilians during natural disasters</li>
            <li>Evacuation of Indian nationals from foreign countries in case of instability or other problems</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            In practice, this is taken as a directive meaning the IAF bears the responsibility of safeguarding Indian
            airspace and thus furthering national interests in conjunction with the other branches of the armed forces.
            The IAF provides close air support to the Indian Army troops on the battlefield as well as strategic and
            tactical airlift capabilities. The Integrated Space Cell is operated by the Indian Armed Forces, the
            civilian Department of Space, and the Indian Space Research Organisation. By uniting the civilian run space
            exploration organisations and the military faculty under a single Integrated Space Cell the military is able
            to efficiently benefit from innovation in the civilian sector of space exploration, and the civilian
            departments benefit as well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Indian Air Force, with highly trained crews, pilots, and access to modern military assets provides India
            with the capacity to provide rapid response evacuation, search-and-rescue (SAR) operations, and delivery of
            relief supplies to affected areas via cargo aircraft. The IAF provided extensive assistance to relief
            operations during natural calamities such as the Gujarat cyclone in 1998, the tsunami in 2004, and North
            India floods in 2013.The IAF has also undertaken relief missions such as Operation Rainbow in Sri Lanka.

        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>Formation and Early points</h2>
        <p>The Indian Air Force was established on 8 October 1932 in British India as an auxiliary air force[23] of the
            Royal Air Force. The enactment of the Indian Air Force Act 1932[24][25] stipulated out their auxiliary
            status and enforced the adoption of the Royal Air Force uniforms, badges, brevets and insignia.[26] On 1
            April 1933, the IAF commissioned its first squadron, No.1 Squadron, with four Westland Wapiti biplanes and
            five Indian pilots. The Indian pilots were led by British RAF Commanding officer Flight Lieutenant (later
            Air Vice Marshal) Cecil Bouchier.[27]
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>World War II (1939-1945)</h2>
        <p>
            During World War II, the IAF played an instrumental role in halting the advance of the Japanese army
            in Burma, where the first IAF air strike was executed. The target for this first mission was the
            Japanese military base in Arakan, after which IAF strike missions continued against the Japanese
            airbases at Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai in northern Thailand
            The IAF was mainly involved in strike, close air support, aerial reconnaissance, bomber escort and
            pathfinding missions for RAF and USAAF heavy bombers. RAF and IAF pilots would train by flying with
            their non-native air wings to gain combat experience and communication proficiency. Besides
            operations in the Burma Theatre IAF pilots participated in air operations in North Africa and
            Europe.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>First years of independence (1947â€“1950)
        </h2>
        <p>After it became independent from the British Empire in 1947, British India was partitioned into the new states of the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. Along the lines of the geographical partition, the assets of the air force were divided between the new countries. India's air force retained the name of the Royal Indian Air Force, but three of the ten operational squadrons and facilities, located within the borders of Pakistan, were transferred to the Royal Pakistan Air Force.[30] The RIAF Roundel was changed to an interim 'Chakra' roundel derived from the Ashoka Chakra</p>
