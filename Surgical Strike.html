            <p>5 Years of Surgical Strike: The government along with top army officers prepared a special plan and the night time of 28-29 September was chosen to execute it. This was the day when the army had succeeded in destroying terrorist camps by entering Pakistan in just 4 hours of operation.</p>

                Today, 5 years have been completed of the surgical strike carried out by India on terrorist bases inside Pakistan. On this day in the year 2016, Indian soldiers entered the Pakistani border and destroyed terrorist bases. This day was recorded forever as a witness to the courageous step of the Indian soldiers. The question arises that why India did surgical strike? However, the Indian Army had cited the continuous infiltration from across the border as the reason behind this. But experts believe the reason behind this is something else.In fact, it was the month of September in the year 2016, terrorists attacked army personnel in the Uri sector along the border in Jammu and Kashmir. 19 Indian soldiers were martyred in this attack. The attack on the Indian Army Headquarters in Uri by Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists spread anger across India. The opposition started dominating the government. Only then did the central government prepare a plan to blow up the hideouts of Jaish-e-Mohammed.The government, along with the top army officers, prepared a special plan and to execute it, the time of the night of 28-29 September was chosen. This was the day when the army had succeeded in destroying terrorist camps by entering Pakistan in just 4 hours of operation.

            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">How was the operation done?</h2>
            <p>
                According to the information, the army started the operation 'Monkey' at around 12.30 in the night and finished the work of the terrorists by 4.30 in the morning. Special Forces and Para Commandos were also involved in this entire operation. 150 commandos from MI 17 helicopters were landed near the LoC near the border i.e. airdropped. After this, the Indian soldiers gradually managed to enter the Pakistani border. During this time the Indian commandos were equipped with night vision devices, smoke grenades, Tavor and M-4-like rifles, grenades, under-barrel grenade launchers and helmet-mounted cameras.

While marching, the commandos had entered three kilometers inside Pakistan. The Indian Army took action in Bhimber, Hotspring, Tattapani, Kel, Lipa sectors of PoK and destroyed the launch pads of the terrorists with rapid firing. About 38 terrorists were eliminated in this surgical strike by the Indian Army and two Pakistani soldiers present there were also killed.

The interesting thing is that none of the commandos of India were harmed in any way and they successfully completed the operation and returned to India. It was 4.30 in the morning and the army commandos had returned to India. After this, India announced that Indian soldiers have entered Pakistan and destroyed the terrorist bases of Jaish-e-Mohammed and a large number of terrorists have also been eliminated. The story of bravery of Indian soldiers on this operation has also been featured in the film 'Uri'.
