            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Wing Commander Vijay Karnik had praised Indubhai</h2>
            <p>
                Indubhai had been in the field during the 1965 and 1971 India-Pakistan wars. Ajay Devgan who is playing the role of Wing Commander Vijay Karnik in Bhuj movie told Dainik Bhaskar about the articles of late Indubhai that Indubhai was an honest journalist. He wrote several episodes of bravery and sacrifice of Indian soldiers during the battle at Bhuj. Journalists usually do not go to the battlefield, but Indubhai was with us. They were collecting all the information by taking photographs of each incident. At that time there were bomb blasts all around, while Indubhai was fearlessly writing his report. The stories of the bravery of our jawans reached the people only because of their reporting.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Vijay Karnik , who captured the bravery of the heroines on camera,
says that during the war, Indubhai used to bring Dhokla from his house for us. Basically I am a Marathi person, but I was fond of Gujarati cuisine. I had specifically instructed my officers not to stop Indubhai from letting him go whenever and wherever he wanted. Even when we were getting the runway constructed with the help of the brave women of Bhuj, Indubhai was with us all the time and he wrote about all those women in his articles about how the women of Bhuj stood shoulder to shoulder with the jawans amidst the bomb blasts. They were standing shoulder to shoulder.

            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Important contribution of the women of Bhuj
            </h2>
            <p>In fact, at that time Pakistan had destroyed the runway of Bhuj airport (which was also a military airport). Due to the bomb falling in the middle of the airstrip, there were big pits in many places. If the runway was not repaired in time, it would not have been possible for Indian planes to take off. This situation had never happened before, so no one had experience working in such a situation.
                
                Finally, Vijay Karnik, the then Air Force Commander of Bhuj Airport, Kutch Collector N. Seeked help from Gopal Swami. Gopal Swamy took the responsibility of providing manpower to repair the airstrip and within hours an army of about 300 women from Madhapar village stood ready to help the Indian soldiers. The next morning, the women were collected at the nearby village of Vathan, from where they were brought to the Bhuj airport. Women skilled in construction work brought with them all the tools like shovels and hammers.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Late Indubhai was the District Information Officer in the Information Department of the Government of Gujarat in 1961. Meanwhile, according to a special order issued by the Government of India in September 1965, foreign journalists were taken to the front lines of the Indo-Pak war. Due to this, the anti-India rumors were denied. Indubhai then took many photographs of the war front and informed the whole world including India with his reports.

Instead of writing a press note
, Indubhai could have written a press note sitting in his room, but he did not do so. He himself used to stand directly on the battlefield with his pen and notebook, so that he could be aware of each and every incident. Not only this, even when bombs started falling from Pakistan side in Bhuj, Indubhai stood with the Indian soldiers. This bravery of his makes him an honest journalist.

India occupied an area ranging from 1200 to 1400 km
Niralabhai Joshi, Indubhai's son and Deputy Information Director of Rajkot Information Department, has made a documentary showing the condition of soldiers of India and Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistan war. In a scene in the documentary, Indubhai said, "I remember it very well. On the night of December 1, 1971, Pakistan attacked India. I was reporting there at that time. There is a small desert of Kutch between Sui village and the distance between these two is 200 km. The battle was taking place in this small desert. The border of Pakistan is just 10 km from Sui village of Banaskantha and Pakistan's The first village is Nagarparkar. India attacked Nagarparkar and captured the village on 8th December. After that Indian troops occupied 1200 to 1400 km of Pak land. And I saw all this with my own eyes."
