                <p>
                    After the Pulwama attack and airstrike, the tension between India and Pakistan is continuously
                    increasing. Recently, Pakistan has accused India that there has been an intrusion into their
                    maritime border from an Indian side. The increasing pressure in the maritime border of the two
                    countries is not new. The Bollywood film 'Ghazi Attack' has been made on the story of one such war
                    of 1971. The movie depicts the eye-to-eye battle between Indian's INS Vikrant and Pakistani
                    submarine PNS Ghazi.

                    In the war of 1971, Pakistan knew that India's INS Vikrant is the factor to change the picture of
                    the war. In this battle, Pakistan sent its Naval Submarine Ghazi to sink INS Vikrant, which is said
                    to have been sunk on the intervening night of 3 and 4 December. PNS Ghazi-71 was the most hidden
                    lethal weapon of Pakistan in the war. At that time India did not have a single submarine. In such a
                    situation, stopping Ghazi was a challenging task. An even bigger challenge was Ghazi's psychological
                    intimidation. If Ghazi had succeeded in his mission, it would have been a big defeat for India
                    psychologically. Which would have affected the outcome of the 1971 war as well.

                    Ghazi had the ability to travel 20 thousand kilometers long. That's why Ghazi was quietly sent from
                    Karachi to the Bay of Bengal between 14 November and 22 November just before the war of 71 started.
                    But his real mission is to find and destroy the aircraft carrier Vikrant. The Indian Navy had come
                    to know from signal interception that Ghazi is somewhere in the sea between Karachi to Bay of
                    Bengal. This was bad news for Vikrant, who had left the port of Visakhapatnam for a maritime siege
                    of East Pakistan.
